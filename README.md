# E-LEARNING-PLATFORM-UI

*COMPANY*: CODTECH IT SOLUTION

*NAME*: KHUSHI JAIN

*INTERN ID*: CT06DA779

*DOMAIN*: FRONTEND WEB DEVELOPMENT

*DURATION*: 6 WEEKS

*MENTOR*: NEELAM SANTOSH

*BASED ON THE IMAGE OF YOUR PROJECT, YOU HAVE DESIGNED A CLEAN AND MODERN FRONT-END FOR AN E-LEARNING PLATFORM USING HTML, CSS, AND MAYBE A LITTLE JAVASCRIPT. THIS PLATFORM IS MEANT TO HELP USERS LEARN DIFFERENT PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES BY WATCHING VIDEOS AND TRACKING THEIR PROGRESS. THE DESIGN IS RESPONSIVE, SIMPLE, AND USER-FRIENDLY — PERFECT FOR BEGINNERS WHO WANT TO LEARN IN AN ORGANIZED WAY.*

*AT THE TOP OF THE PAGE, YOU HAVE A NICE HEADER WITH THE TITLE “E-LEARNING PLATFORM.” IT IS CENTERED AND STANDS OUT DUE TO THE GRADIENT BACKGROUND. THIS GIVES THE WEBSITE A PROFESSIONAL LOOK WHILE REMAINING SIMPLE.*

*BELOW THE HEADER, YOU HAVE DISPLAYED MULTIPLE COURSE CARDS. EACH CARD CONTAINS IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT A SPECIFIC COURSE. FOR EXAMPLE, THERE ARE COURSES LIKE “INTRODUCTION TO JAVASCRIPT,” “HTML & CSS BASICS,” “REACT FOR BEGINNERS,” AND “PYTHON PROGRAMMING FUNDAMENTALS.” EACH CARD INCLUDES A TITLE, A SHORT DESCRIPTION OF THE COURSE, A PROGRESS BAR, COMPLETION PERCENTAGE, AND A “WATCH VIDEO” BUTTON.*

*THE PROGRESS BAR IN EACH CARD IS VERY USEFUL. IT SHOWS HOW MUCH OF THE COURSE HAS BEEN COMPLETED. FOR EXAMPLE, THE JAVASCRIPT COURSE SHOWS 40% COMPLETED, HTML & CSS SHOWS 50%, REACT HAS 35%, AND PYTHON HAS 60%. THIS VISUAL FEEDBACK MOTIVATES USERS TO CONTINUE THEIR LEARNING.*

*THE “WATCH VIDEO” BUTTON IS PLACED NICELY AND LOOKS INTERACTIVE. WHEN USERS CLICK IT, IT CAN EITHER OPEN A VIDEO PLAYER OR REDIRECT TO A VIDEO LESSON PAGE. THIS MAKES IT EASY TO ACCESS LEARNING CONTENT WITH JUST ONE CLICK.*

*OVERALL, THIS PROJECT IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF A FRONT-END E-LEARNING PLATFORM. IT IS A MULTI-COURSE INTERFACE THAT FOCUSES ON GOOD DESIGN, EASY NAVIGATION, AND USER EXPERIENCE. EVEN THOUGH IT IS BASIC, IT COVERS ALL THE IMPORTANT FEATURES — COURSE LISTING, VIDEO ACCESS, AND PROGRESS TRACKING.*
